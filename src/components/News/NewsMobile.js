                        Psyonix has decided to celebrate the first week of Spring with some Spike Rush!
                        We will be putting togther tournaments and streaming throughout the weekend.

                        In other news, one of the co-founders of RSR has recently gone from unemployed to 
                        having two jobs. Expect to have fully funded Ranked Spike Rush tourneys in the near 
                        future with prize pools large enough to bring everyone back together and remember
                        why we all love this playlist so much.
                        <br/><br/>
                        More details coming soon!

                    Thank you to everyone who helped make our first ever 
                    Ranked Spike Rush tournament a huge success! Although 
                    the tournament itself lasted almost twice as long as we 
                    originally intended (almost 6 hours!) we appreciate 
                    everyone who stuck around and got to enjoy the climactic 
                    ending. A special shoutout to the top donators: Q, thatguyluda, 
                    Dany, Josh and Kelaiditis for their contributions to our $175 prize 
                    pool!
