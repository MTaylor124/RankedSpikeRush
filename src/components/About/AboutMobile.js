                        Here at RankedSpikeRush.gg we are a community of Rocket League players who 
                        believe Spike Rush is the only skill-based playlist that Psyonix has ever
                        made. And for that reason it deserves to be its very own ranked game mode!

                        Join us as we lead the coalition to give this glorious playlist the respect
                        it deserves. We will be hosting tournaments and streaming our games at least
                        for the short time that Spike Rush is back.
